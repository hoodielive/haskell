Learn Haskell
-> Haskell is a purely functional, lazy, statically typed programming language.
	-> Purely Functional
		-> functions are values 
		-> values 'never' change
	
	-> Lazy
		-> just means, it's non-strict -> not going to run unless you are deliberate
		-> helps to write some amazingly clean algorithms

	-> Statically Typed 
	

-> Why should you learn it?
	-> Its not really hard, just different 
	-> C-Engineering (language of OS(es) and low-level programming) -> bare metal|machine
	-> Java/C# (language of businesses) 
	-> Haskell (Mathematics) 
		-> Patient development 
		-> Strong theoretical roots (strong mathematical roots) 
			-> monads 
		-> Fosters innovation 
			-> crypto, cloud-computing
		-> Industrial strength 
		-> High Permomance
		-> Libraries 
		-> 3D Graphics

-> History 
	-> 1980s - many functional programming languages 
	-> 1987 - standardization committee formed
	-> 1990 - Haskell 1.0
	-> 1997 - Haskell 98 
	-> 2009 - Haskell 2010 
	-> Many compilers died -> but Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiliation System (GHC) survived and emerged as the defacto compiler

-> Tools 
	-> Haskell Platform (install -> sudo apt-get install haskell-platform) 
	-> www.haskell.org 
	-> ghci
